# 🔐 Encryption Techniques — 05

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand cryptography basics  
- Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption  
- Learn hashing and digital signature concepts  

---

## 🧩 Cryptography
Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications using codes to ensure confidentiality.

---

## 🔸 Symmetric Encryption
- Uses one key for both encryption and decryption.  
- Fast, suitable for bulk data encryption.  

---

## 🔹 Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses two keys: public key (for encryption) and private key (for decryption).  
- Used for secure key exchange and digital communication.  

---

## 🔑 Hashing
- Converts data into a fixed-length string.
- one_way process - cannot be reversed.
- used for password storage and intergrity checking.
- common algorithms: SHA-256, MD5 (deprecated),

## digital signatures and certificates
- Ensure authentication and non-repudiation.
- A digital signature uses private key to sign data and public key verify.
- certification (x.509)are issued by certification Authorities (CAs) for trust verification authorities (CAs) for trust verification in

## Example:
