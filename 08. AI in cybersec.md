# Artificial inteligence (AI) in cybersecurity
## Core Concept

### Role of AI/ML in Cybersecurity
- Machine Learning for instruct detection and malware analysis
- Predictive analysis for attack prevention
- AI-driven SOC automation (SOAR tools)

### AI Techniqoes in Security
- Supervised learning: Malware classification (Bening vs Malicious)
- Unsupervised learing: Anomaly detection in logs
- Reinforcement learninf: Adaptive responce system

### Application of AI in Threat Detection
- Email phising detection using NLP
- Behavior-based endpoint protection
- Network traffic anomaly detection (IDS/IPS enhancement)
- User and Entityt Behavior Analysis (UEBA)

### AI Powered Tools & Platforms
- IBM QRadar Advisor with Watson
- Darktrace (AI for network anomaly detection)
- Crowdstrike Flacon (AI endpoint protection)
- CylancePROTECT, Azure sentinel (ML-based alerts)

### Limitations & Ethical challenges
- Adversarial ML (poisoning data, evasion attacks)
- privacy concerns (training data exposure)
- explainability issues (AI decision trasparency)
